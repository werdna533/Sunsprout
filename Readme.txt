Hints on how to play:
- If you click the pause button, you can end the game sooner than losing three lives or having no flowers left.

Any functionalities missing from the original plan for the game:
- In the original game plan, I said I would add seasons if I had enough time. I did not have enough time. 
- I also said that I would add a seed bouncing animation if I had enough time. I did not have enough time for this either. 
- Additionally, I planned a status effect called dehydrated for when a flower was not watered after a long period of time. I did not have enough time to add this. 

Any additional functionalities added from your original plan:
- Added a pause button in the game screen.
- Added a “enter your username” page. 
- Added different flower rarities that give a different number of points.
- Made the highscores screen more detailed. I made a separate highscores list for each difficulty mode (easy, medium, hard), and the list can be sorted three ways.

Known bugs / errors:
- Game is laggy when there are too many projectiles on screen. 
- The collisions between projectiles and clouds is not the most precise. 
- Sometimes, sound effects do not play. Commonly occurs when one sound effect is played multiple times over a short period of time.
